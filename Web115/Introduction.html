<p> - Personal background: Grew up in New York City and moved to Charlotte in 2016 since the cost of living in NYC is way too high. I have two chihuahuas who think the sofa is their bed.
</p>
<p> - Professional: I worked at the Dunkinâ€™ on Pineville-Matthews Rd for 3 years, and currently work for the I&T Service Desk for the City of Charlotte.</p>
<p> - Academic background: I did elementary, middle school, and freshmen year of highschool in NYC, and completed highschool at South Meck here. Currently attending CPCC to get a degree in full stack Programming.</p>
<p> - Background in this subject: I've been using computers since I was a kid, and often do coding for side hobbies, though I am not as good at it as I would like. </p>
<p> - Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10. </p>
  <p>Courses I'm in & Why:</p>

	</ul>
<p>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I collect games as a hobby, dating as far back as the NES and as obscure as the Sega Nomad and Sega Game Gear.</p>
